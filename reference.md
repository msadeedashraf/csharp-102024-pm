### Inheritance
Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a class (child or derived class) to inherit the fields, methods, and properties of another class (parent or base class). This helps in code reuse and implementing polymorphism.

We group the "inheritance concept" into two categories:

Derived Class (child) - the class that inherits from another class
Base Class (parent) - the class being inherited from



Polymorphism (overloading and overriding)

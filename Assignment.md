1. Create a 4 function Calculator ![link](/Assets/Four-Function-Calculator.png)
2. Create a Program that can help you deposit/withdraw the amount from a Account Balance ![link](/Assets/Bank-Acount-Deposit-Withdrawal.png)
3. Convert the user temperature from C to F and F to C;
4. int fahrenheit = 94;
decimal celsius = (fahrenheit - 32m) * (5m / 9m);
Console.WriteLine("The temperature is " + celsius + " Celsius.");
5. Create a class called LibraryBook that represents a book in a library system. The class should have the following properties and methods:

Properties:

Title (string): The title of the book.
Author (string): The author of the book.
ISBN (string): The ISBN of the book.
IsCheckedOut (bool): Tracks whether the book is currently checked out.
Constructor: Create a constructor that initializes the title, author, and ISBN. By default, set IsCheckedOut to false.

Methods:

CheckOut(): If the book is not already checked out, set IsCheckedOut to true and display a message indicating the book has been checked out. If the book is already checked out, display a message stating it is not available.
ReturnBook(): If the book is currently checked out, set IsCheckedOut to false and display a message indicating the book has been returned. If the book is already in the library, display a message stating it is already available.
DisplayBookInfo(): Print the book information, including title, author, ISBN, and whether it is currently available.
Usage Example:

Create an instance of LibraryBook in a Main method with a sample title, author, and ISBN.
Call DisplayBookInfo() to display the book details.
Call CheckOut() and ReturnBook() to test the book's **status** and re-display the information.

Requirements:
1. Implement the LibraryBook class with the required properties, constructor, and methods.
2. Ensure that the CheckOut and ReturnBook methods update the IsCheckedOut status correctly.
3. Test your program by creating a sample book in the Main method and performing a sequence of actions.

Extra Challenge: Add validation in the CheckOut and ReturnBook methods to ensure a book cannot be checked out or returned if it is in an inappropriate state.
